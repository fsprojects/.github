An F# Community Space for incubating open community projects.

## Requesting transfer

To request a project to be added or removed from the F# Community Incubation space, [please add an issue to this repository](https://github.com/fsprojects/FsProjectsAdmin/issues/new).

## Onboarding process 

After you add an issue to request moving to "fsprojects"

1. We make you owner of the https://github.com/fsprojects-transfer/ organization
2. You  transfer ownership to https://github.com/fsprojects-transfer/ using GitHub's "transfer project" feature. 
3. We then complete the transfer to https://github.com/fsprojects.  

You remain admin on the project and are expected to continue to respond to issues and make new releases.  

GitHub implicitly redirects accesses to your repo (though not to the old URL of the gh-pages of your repo).  Issues and/or wiki are transferred.

After that, the following are normal:

* A section gets added to the README.md like [this one](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Compatibility#maintainers)

* You may get help with continuous integration and/or cross-platform builds for the repo.

* If you don't have much testing or documentation, you may get issues added saying "please add testing" or "please add documentation".  

* Your project will automatically get listed on http://fsprojects.github.io

* You may receive a request to make "fsprojects" a co-owner on any nuget packages associated with the repo.  This is to ensure the project canhas the possibility of living on should you abandon it or not longer be able to publish nuget packages.

* Should you abandon the project, the owners of "fsprojects" are backup owners. They will try to recruit a new owner.

* The project *might* be a bit more visible, so you may get more feedback or contributions. Historically this has happened for many projects.
